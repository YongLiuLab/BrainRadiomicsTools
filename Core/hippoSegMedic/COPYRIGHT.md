### BRATS data for the examples

In order to run the examples, along with the source code of DeepMedic we include a number of Nifti files in the subdirectory: examples/dataForExamples/brats2015TrainingData.
They are a subset of the training data from the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2015 (http://braintumorsegmentation.org/).
They were downloaded from https://www.virtualskeleton.ch/BRATS/Start2015.

The challenge and the data are described in the paper:

Menze, B. H., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Farahani, K.,
Kirby, J., Burren, Y., Porz, N., Slotboom, J., Wiest, R., et al., 2015. The
multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (brats). Medical
Imaging, IEEE Transactions on 34 (10), 1993-2024.
